# Forest_Fire_Detection
This code uses OpenCV to detect fire in an image by identifying red-colored regions. It converts the image to HSV color space, creates a mask for red areas, finds contours in the mask, and then highlights these regions to detect fire. If fire is detected, it draws bounding boxes around the detected fire areas and displays the image.
